    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I was child my mom always used to make the best lasagna. Because she was such a narcacist, she never shared that recipe with anyone, including me. She died without ever divulging it to anyone and no one could ever find a record of it anywhere.</p>
    <p>Say what you will about the woman but her lasagna was the best lasagna you could have ever tasted in your whole sad, empty life. So, to spite her, I spent years trying to recreate the flavours and exquisite mouth feel of her coveted lasagna and I think this recipe has achieved just that.</p>
    <p>So please, use this recipe to help me spread the taste across the globe and rub it into my bitch mom's dead ass face!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar of spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 pound shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Say a prayer to my mother, may she burn in hell, and enjoy!</li>
